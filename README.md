# Zavrsni
Source code used for writing final assignment. All three programs (made in C, Python and Python/C) do the same task, finding all prime numbers up to certain positive long integer n using slightly optimised Sieve of Eratosthenes.

primesC.c contains C implementation.
pytest.py contains Python implementation.
Folder named Zavrsni contains:
  - primes.c which has a C code for Python extension
  - setup.py which sets up the extension and package
  - ctest.py which is a script used for running/testing the extension
